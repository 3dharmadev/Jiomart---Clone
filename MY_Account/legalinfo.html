</p>
<h4>
1. Our Contract of Sale
</h4>
<p>
1.1. Listing and display of a Product by us on JioMart is our invitation to you to make an offer for purchase of such Product. Likewise, the placement of an order on JioMart by you is your offer to buy the Product(s) from us.
</p>
<p>
1.2. Once you have placed an order with us for purchase of a Product, you will receive an e-mail confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the “Order Confirmation”). The Order Confirmation is merely an acknowledgement that we have received your order and does not signify our acceptance of your offer.
</p>
<p>
1.3. We only accept your offer and conclude the contract of sale for a Product ordered by you, when the Product is shipped or dispatched to you and an e-mail confirmation is sent to you that the Product has been shipped or dispatched to you (the “Shipment Confirmation”). We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason whatsoever before sending Shipment Confirmation to you.
</p>
<p>
1.4. You acknowledge that there may be certain Products in your order whose actual quantity may not be known at the time of order placement (for example, fruits, vegetables, etc.). Such Products will therefore be invoiced based on the exact weight at the time of packaging and upon dispatch, our Shipment Confirmation will reflect such marginal variance in the quantity of the Product as against your original order and relevant adjustment in the invoice amount.
</p>
<p>
1.5. If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive separate Shipment Confirmations for each package, and each Shipment Confirmation and corresponding dispatch will conclude a separate contract of sale between you and us for the Product(s) specified in that Shipment Confirmation.
</p>
<p>
1.6. Your contract is with us and you confirm that the Product(s) ordered by you are purchased for your internal / personal purpose and not for re-sale or business purpose. Please note that we sell Products only in quantities which correspond to the usual requirements of an average household. This applies both to the number of Products ordered within a single order and the placing of several orders for the same Product where the individual orders comprise a quantity typical for a normal household.
</p>
<p>
1.7. You can cancel your order for a Product at no cost at any time before we send the Shipment Confirmation relating to that Product.
